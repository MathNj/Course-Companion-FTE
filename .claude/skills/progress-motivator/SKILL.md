That's real progress that no one can take away from you.

Streaks are fun, but learning is what counts. Your knowledge

who kept showing up. You can do this!"

4. **Get Streak Info** - Calculate and display learning streak
5. **Calculate Achievements** - Determine unlocked achievements

### Backend Data Structure

The skill expects this progress data:

```json
{
  "user_progress": {
    "total_chapters_completed": 8,
    "total_chapters": 15,
    "overall_completion_percent": 53,
    "current_streak": 12,
    "longest_streak": 18,
    "time_invested_hours": 24
  },
  "chapter_progress": [
    {"chapter": "Introduction", "completed": true, "score": 95},
    {"chapter": "Neural Networks", "completed": true, "score": 88}
  ],
  "quiz_performance": {
    "quizzes_taken": 12,
    "average_score": 87,
    "perfect_scores": 4,
