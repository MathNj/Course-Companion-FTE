# **The Agent Factory Thesis**

***"In the AI era, the most valuable companies won't sell software—they'll manufacture digital employees, powered by agents, specs, skills, MCP, A2A, autonomy and cloud-native technologies."***

This paper presents the complete architecture for an Agent Factory—a system where General Agents (like Claude Code) manufacture Custom Agents (Digital FTEs) through Spec-Driven Development. The result: autonomous digital employees that work 168 hours per week, performing specialized business tasks with enterprise-grade reliability.

## **The Core Strategic Decision: Two Paths to Agentic AI**

| Aspect | General Agents ("Smart Consultant") | Custom Agents ("Assembly Line") |
| ----- | ----- | ----- |
| Examples | Claude Code, Goose, Gemini CLI | Built with OpenAI Agents SDK, Claude Agent SDK |
| Focus | High-level reasoning, autonomy, flexibility | Reliability, process control, specific workflows |
| Analogy | Hiring a senior employee who figures out HOW to solve the problem | Building a factory machine that performs a specific task perfectly every time |
| Best For | Complex debugging, ad-hoc analysis, tasks requiring human-like judgment | SOPs, high-volume tasks (5,000 invoices), customer-facing interactions |
| Role | THE BUILDER — manufactures Custom Skills and Custom Agents | THE PRODUCT — deployed in production as Digital FTEs |
| Cost Model | Expensive per task but invaluable for non-routine work | Optimized for volume ($0.25-0.50 per task vs $3-6 human) |

# **The Agent Factory Architecture**

The Agent Factory is a system where General Agents use Spec-Driven Development to manufacture Custom Skills and Custom Agents. Code is the Universal Interface that makes this possible.

# **Digital FTE: The New Unit of Value**

A Digital FTE (Full-Time Equivalent) is an AI agent that is built, "hired," and priced as if it were a human employee. This shifts the conversation from "software licenses" to "headcount budgets."

## **Human FTE vs Digital FTE**

| Feature | Human FTE | Digital FTE (Custom Agent) |
| ----- | ----- | ----- |
| Availability | 40 hours / week | 168 hours / week (24/7) |
| Monthly Cost | $4,000 – $8,000+ | $500 – $2,000 |
| Ramp-up Time | 3 – 6 Months | Instant (via SKILL.md) |
| Consistency | Variable (85–95% accuracy) | Predictable (99%+ consistency) |
| Scaling | Linear (Hire 10 for 10x work) | Exponential (Instant duplication) |
| Cost per Task | \~$3.00 – $6.00 | \~$0.25 – $0.50 |
| Annual Hours | \~2,000 hours | \~8,760 hours |

**The 'Aha\!' Moment: A Digital FTE works nearly 9,000 hours a year vs a human's 2,000. The cost per task reduction (from \~$5.00 to \~$0.50) is an 85–90% cost saving—usually the threshold where a CEO approves a project without further debate.**

# 

# **Agent Skills — Domain Knowledge & Procedures**

Agent Skills, released by Anthropic in October 2025 and opened as an independent standard in December 2025, provide Digital FTEs with procedural knowledge and domain expertise. While MCP acts as the "plumbing" (connecting to tools and data), Agent Skills serve as the "manual" (teaching the agent how to use those connections effectively).

## **What Are Agent Skills?**

A Skill is a directory containing a SKILL.md file with instructions, scripts, and resources that teach an AI agent how to perform specific tasks consistently. Rather than crafting elaborate prompts, Skills package procedural knowledge into reusable modules.

### **The Progressive Disclosure Pattern**

Skills use progressive disclosure to manage context efficiently:

| Level | Content | When Loaded |
| ----- | ----- | ----- |
| Metadata | Name \+ one-line description | Always (minimal tokens) |
| SKILL.md | Workflows, procedures, best practices | When skill is triggered |
| Resources | Additional docs, scripts, templates | When referenced by SKILL.md |

## **Enterprise Partner Skills**

Leading enterprise software vendors have contributed Skills to the ecosystem:

| Partner | Skills Provided |
| ----- | ----- |
| Atlassian | Manage Jira tickets, search Confluence, orchestrate sprints, triage issues |
| Stripe | Customer profiles, refund processing, transaction auditing, financial operations |
| Figma | Design system management, component creation, design-to-code workflows |
| Notion | Knowledge base management, documentation workflows, project tracking |
| Zapier | Automation workflows, multi-app integrations, trigger management |
| Canva | Brand asset creation, design templates, visual content generation |

## **Skills for Digital FTEs**

Each Digital FTE role should have dedicated Skills that encode its procedural expertise:

* Research Analyst FTE: Literature review procedures, source evaluation criteria, citation standards, synthesis methodologies, report formatting

* Software Developer FTE: Code review checklist, testing procedures, PR templates, architecture decision records, deployment runbooks

* Customer Support FTE: Ticket triage procedures, escalation criteria, response templates, SLA management, knowledge base search patterns

* Financial Analyst FTE: DCF modeling procedures, comparable analysis workflows, earnings model templates, regulatory compliance checklists

# **MCP — Tool & Data Integration**

The Model Context Protocol (MCP), released by Anthropic in November 2024 and donated to the Linux Foundation's Agentic AI Foundation (AAIF) in December 2025, provides standardized connectivity between agents and external systems. MCP is the "USB-C for AI"—a universal way to connect agents to tools, databases, and APIs.

## **MCP Architecture**

┌─────────────────┐     ┌─────────────────┐     ┌─────────────────┐  
│   MCP Client    │     │   MCP Server    │     │  External API   │  
│  (Claude SDK)   │◄───►│  (Your Code)    │◄───►│   (Slack, DB)   │  
└─────────────────┘     └─────────────────┘     └─────────────────┘

• Client: The agent requesting tool access  
• Server: Exposes tools with standardized schemas  
• Protocol: JSON-RPC over stdio, HTTP, or SSE

## **MCP Servers for Digital FTEs**

Common MCP servers that extend Digital FTE capabilities:

| MCP Server | Capabilities | Use Case |
| ----- | ----- | ----- |
| Slack | Read/send messages, manage channels | Team communication, status updates |
| Google Drive | Read/write docs, search files | Document management, collaboration |
| PostgreSQL | Query database, schema inspection | Data analysis, reporting |
| GitHub | PRs, issues, code search, actions | Development workflows |
| Jira | Create/update tickets, sprint management | Project tracking |
| Web Search | Real-time internet search | Research, fact-checking |

# 

# **Agent Skills \+ MCP: The Building Blocks**

| Component | Agent Skills ("The How-To") | MCP ("The With-What") |
| ----- | ----- | ----- |
| Definition | Modular folders with SKILL.md that teach an agent a specific, repeatable workflow | Model Context Protocol—the data pipe that connects skills to live data |
| Purpose | Standardizing expertise into reusable, monetizable IP | Connectivity to databases, APIs, enterprise systems |
| Example | "Analyze financial statements according to our Q4 risk framework" | Connect to SQL database, Jira, Salesforce, Xero |
| Analogy | The employee manual / training program | The employee's access badges and tools |

Plug in a Finance MCP \+ Finance Skill → It's a Finance Agent. Plug in a Sales MCP \+ Sales Skill → It's a Sales Agent. Code is just the glue that holds it all together.

# **Two Levels of Agent Skills**

| Skill Level | Used By | Purpose | Examples |
| ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- |
| Development Skills | General Agent (Claude Code) | BUILD the Custom Agent / Digital FTE | fastapi-service, dapr-workflow, kubernetes-deploy |
| Runtime Skills | Custom Agent (Digital FTE) | EXECUTE business tasks in production | invoice-validation, research-analyst, code-review |

# **Complete Technical Architecture**

The Custom Agent (Digital FTE) runs on a production-ready, cloud-native stack:

| Layer | Technology | Role | Built By (General Agent) |
| ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- |
| L0 | [Agent Sandbox (gVisor)](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/agent-sandbox) | Secure execution | kubernetes-deploy skill |
| L1 | Apache Kafka | Event backbone | kafka-setup skill |
| L2 | Dapr \+ Workflows | Infrastructure \+ Durability | dapr-workflow skill |
| L3 | FastAPI | HTTP interface \+ A2A | fastapi-service skill |
| L4 | OpenAI Agents SDK | High-level orchestration | openai-agents-sdk skill |
| L5 | Claude Agent SDK | Agentic execution engine | claude-agent-sdk skill |
| L6 | Runtime Skills \+ MCP | Domain knowledge \+ Tools | skill-creator skill |
| L7 | A2A Protocol | Multi-FTE collaboration | a2a-protocol skill |

**Total Infrastructure Licensing Cost: $0**

Only pay-per-token for LLM API calls (Claude, GPT-5, Gemini)

The key insight in this architecture is using Dapr Workflows for durable execution instead of expensive alternatives like Temporal Cloud. Dapr Workflows provides the same crash-recovery guarantees while being completely free and already integrated into Kubernetes infrastructure layer.

Building a true Digital FTE (Full-Time Employee)—an autonomous agent capable of sustained, multi-hour or multi-day work—requires more than selecting a single SDK. Production Digital FTEs demand a secure, event-driven hybrid architecture built on six foundational technologies.

This paper provides a comprehensive architecture and implementation guide for building production-ready Digital FTEs that are secure by design, event-driven, crash-proof, horizontally scalable, and enterprise-integrated.

# **The Security Imperative**

## **Why Security Must Be Layer Zero**

OWASP has identified "Agent Tool Interaction Manipulation" as one of the top 10 AI agent threats. This vulnerability occurs when AI agents interact with tools that may include critical infrastructure, IoT devices, or sensitive operational systems. The consequences can be severe:

| Incident | Attack Vector | Impact |
| ----- | ----- | ----- |
| Langflow RCE (2025) | Python exec() exploitation | Remote code execution on server |
| Cursor MCP Auto-Start | Malicious prompt → shell access | Local system compromise |
| Replit AI Code Rogue | LLM-generated destructive code | Database wipe-out |

Digital FTEs are particularly vulnerable because they combine multiple risk factors:

* LLM-Generated Code Execution: Claude Agent SDK executes code that the LLM writes—code that could be influenced by prompt injection

* Computer Use Capabilities: Screenshot capture, mouse/keyboard control, and GUI automation provide attack surface

* Bash Command Execution: Direct shell access means a single malicious command could compromise the system

* Long-Running Autonomy: Extended operation windows (hours to days) increase exposure time

* Enterprise Integration: Access to Kafka, databases, and APIs means blast radius extends beyond the agent

## **The Sandbox-First Principle**

Security expert Yassine Bargach argues that every AI agent needs a sandbox, stating: "Is it better to spend time looking at each user input to see if it is malicious, or to be able to run anything in a secure environment that doesn't affect the end-user?"

Our architecture adopts the sandbox-first principle: assume all LLM-generated code is potentially hostile, and execute it in an environment where even successful exploitation cannot escape to affect the cluster, other workloads, or enterprise systems.

# **Layer 0: Agent Sandbox — Secure Execution Foundation**

The Agent Sandbox is an open-source Kubernetes controller (kubernetes-sigs/agent-sandbox) that provides a declarative API for managing isolated, stateful pods with stable identity and persistent storage. It is purpose-built for executing untrusted, LLM-generated code.

## **How Agent Sandbox Provides Isolation**

Agent Sandbox achieves isolation through multiple mechanisms:

| Mechanism | How It Works | Protection Provided |
| ----- | ----- | ----- |
| gVisor (runsc) | User-space kernel that intercepts syscalls | Prevents container escape to host kernel |
| Kata Containers | Lightweight VM per sandbox | Hardware-level isolation via hypervisor |
| Network Policies | Kubernetes NetworkPolicy CRDs | Limits sandbox → external communication |
| Resource Limits | CPU/Memory/Storage quotas | Prevents resource exhaustion attacks |
| Seccomp Profiles | Syscall filtering | Blocks dangerous syscalls |

## **Agent Sandbox Custom Resources**

The Agent Sandbox provides three Kubernetes Custom Resource Definitions (CRDs):

### **Sandbox**

Represents a single, isolated execution environment with stable identity and persistent storage.

### **SandboxTemplate**

Defines a reusable template for creating sandboxes with consistent configuration—ideal for defining your Digital FTE environment once and instantiating many.

### **SandboxPool**

Maintains a pool of pre-warmed sandboxes ready for instant assignment—eliminates cold start latency when a new FTE task arrives via Kafka.

## **Key Features for Digital FTEs**

1. Stable Identity: Each sandbox has a consistent network identity that survives restarts. Essential for Dapr service discovery and Kafka consumer group membership.

2. Persistent Storage: Working directories persist across sandbox restarts. Claude's generated files, checkpoints, and intermediate outputs survive crashes.

3. Lifecycle Management: Declarative pause, resume, and scheduled deletion. Pause FTEs at night to save costs; auto-delete after TTL expires.

4. Pre-warmed Pools: SandboxPool maintains ready-to-use sandboxes. When a Kafka trigger arrives, assign a pre-warmed sandbox instantly—no container pull latency.

5. Auto-Resume on Reconnect: If network connectivity drops and returns, sandbox automatically resumes operation.

# **Layer 1: Apache Kafka — The Event Backbone**

Kafka (accessed via Dapr's Pub/Sub building block) serves as the nervous system of your Digital FTE infrastructure. Every trigger, status update, and audit event flows through Kafka topics.

## **Kafka's Roles in the Architecture**

1. Trigger Ingestion: External systems publish to fte.triggers.inbound → Dapr Workflow claims sandbox → Claude executes task.

2. Multi-FTE Coordination: Research FTE completes → publishes to fte.handoffs.research → Writer FTE consumes and continues.

3. Enterprise Integration: Consume from CRM, ERP, ITSM topics. Publish results back. No point-to-point integrations.

4. Immutable Audit Trail: Every sandbox action → fte.audit.actions topic with 7-year retention for compliance.

5. Backpressure Management: Kafka buffers work when sandboxes are busy. Consumer groups scale horizontally.

## **Topic Design**

| Topic | Purpose | Retention |
| ----- | ----- | ----- |
| fte.triggers.inbound | New task requests | 7 days (delete after processing) |
| fte.sandbox.lifecycle | Sandbox claim/release events | 30 days (operational analytics) |
| fte.status.updates | Progress events for dashboards | 30 days |
| fte.results.completed | Final outputs for downstream | 90 days |
| fte.audit.actions | Immutable action log | 7 years (compliance) |

# **Layer 2: Dapr — The Unified Infrastructure Layer**

Dapr (Distributed Application Runtime) provides a unified programming model that abstracts infrastructure complexity. The Dapr sidecar runs inside each Agent Sandbox, providing building blocks for pub/sub, state, secrets, and durable workflows.

## **Dapr Building Blocks for Digital FTEs**

* Pub/Sub: Connect to Kafka through a unified API. The sandbox publishes audit events and subscribes to triggers without Kafka client code.

* State Store: Persist agent state (conversation history, checkpoints) in Redis. Survives sandbox restarts via persistent volume \+ state store.

* Secrets Management: API keys fetched from Vault at runtime—never in sandbox environment or Claude's context.

* Service Invocation: Call external services with automatic retries, mTLS, and circuit breaking.

* Workflows: Durable execution engine for long-running FTE tasks. Automatic checkpointing survives sandbox crashes.

# **Dapr Workflows — Durable Execution Engine**

Dapr Workflows provides durable execution for Digital FTEs without additional infrastructure or licensing costs. The workflow engine runs inside the Dapr sidecar and uses Dapr Actors for state management.

## **Workflow Patterns for Digital FTEs**

| Pattern | Use Case | Dapr Implementation |
| ----- | ----- | ----- |
| Task Chaining | Sequential research steps | await ctx.call\_activity() in sequence |
| Fan-Out/Fan-In | Parallel document analysis | ctx.when\_all(\[activities...\]) |
| Human-in-Loop | Manager approval gates | ctx.wait\_for\_external\_event() |
| Compensation | Rollback on failure | try/except with cleanup activities |
| Timers | Scheduled check-ins | ctx.create\_timer(duration) |
| Sub-Workflows | Delegate to specialist FTEs | ctx.call\_child\_workflow() |

# **OpenAI Agents SDK — Orchestration Layer**

The OpenAI Agents SDK provides the orchestration layer for multi-agent coordination. It is provider-agnostic (supports 100+ LLMs) and integrates with Dapr for infrastructure.

## **Key Capabilities**

| Capability | Description |
| ----- | ----- |
| Agents | LLMs with instructions, tools, and model routing (Claude, GPT-5, Gemini via LiteLLM) |
| Handoffs | Transfer control between agents—Research Agent hands off to Coder Agent |
| Guardrails | Input/output validation, PII masking, budget limits, jailbreak detection |
| Sessions | Automatic conversation history across runs |
| Tracing | Built-in observability with Logfire, AgentOps, Braintrust integration |
| Dapr Integration | pip install openai-agents\[dapr\] for native Dapr support |

# 

# **The Agentic Protocol Stack**

Three complementary open standards form the communication and knowledge layers for Digital FTEs:

| Protocol | Focus | Analogy | Governance |
| ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- |
| Agent Skills | What the agent KNOWS | "The manual / SOPs" | Open Standard (agentskills.io) |
| MCP | What the agent CAN ACCESS | "The plumbing / USB-C" | Linux Foundation (AAIF) |
| A2A | Who the agent CAN TALK TO | "The networking layer" | Linux Foundation |

Together, these protocols enable the "Agentic Web"—a future where AI agents from different organizations can collaborate on behalf of users without manual intervention, using standardized discovery, communication, and procedural knowledge.

## **The Hybrid Orchestration Pattern**

Custom Agents (Digital FTEs) use a hybrid architecture combining OpenAI Agents SDK (orchestration) with Claude Agent SDK (agentic execution):

| Capability | OpenAI Agents SDK | Claude Agent SDK |
| ----- | ----- | ----- |
| Role in Custom Agent | Orchestration & coordination | Agentic task execution |
| Handoffs between agents | ✅ Native (first-class) | ❌ Not built-in |
| Guardrails (PII, budget) | ✅ Native | ❌ Manual |
| Computer Use (GUI) | ❌ Not available | ✅ Native (best-in-class) |
| Bash / File operations | ❌ Not available | ✅ Native |
| Native MCP integration | ⚠️ Via custom tools | ✅ First-class |
| Native Agent Skills | ❌ Not available (Under Development) | ✅ First-class |

The hybrid pattern: OpenAI Agents SDK handles orchestration (handoffs, guardrails, sessions) and delegates to Claude Agent SDK when Claude-specific agentic features are required (Computer Use, bash, MCP, Skills). FastAPI serves as the HTTP interface layer, exposing Digital FTEs as services and handling A2A protocol endpoints.

# 

# **How OpenAI Agents SDK Delegates to Claude Agent SDK**

The delegation mechanism is the core of the hybrid architecture. OpenAI Agents SDK's "handoff" feature allows an orchestrating agent to transfer control to specialized agents—including a wrapper around Claude Agent SDK.

# **Spec-Driven Development: The Manufacturing Process**

The General Agent (Claude Code) uses Spec-Driven Development to manufacture Custom Agents. The Spec is your Source Code—if you can describe the excellence you want, AI can build the agent to deliver it.

## **The Blueprint for a Perfect Agent Spec**

# **Development Skills for the General Agent**

These skills teach Claude Code (General Agent) how to manufacture Custom Agents:

## **Skill: openai-agents-sdk**

\# skills/dev/openai-agents-sdk/SKILL.md  
\---  
name: openai-agents-sdk  
description: "Build Custom Agents with OpenAI Agents SDK orchestration"  
triggers: \["custom agent", "orchestration", "handoffs", "guardrails"\]  
\---

\# OpenAI Agents SDK for Custom Agent Orchestration

\#\# Role in Custom Agent Architecture  
OpenAI Agents SDK provides the ORCHESTRATION layer:  
\- Handoffs: Route between specialist agents  
\- Guardrails: Enforce "Assembly Line" reliability  
\- Sessions: Maintain conversation history  
\- Tracing: Production observability

\#\# Key Pattern: Hybrid with Claude Agent SDK  
\`\`\`python  
\# OpenAI SDK for orchestration  
coordinator \= Agent(  
    name="Coordinator",  
    handoffs=\[  
        claude\_executor,  \# Claude SDK for agentic tasks  
        simple\_agent,     \# LiteLLM for simple tasks  
    \],  
    guardrails=\[PIIGuardrail(), BudgetGuardrail()\]  
)  
\`\`\`

\#\# When to Delegate to Claude Agent SDK  
\- GUI automation (Computer Use)  
\- Bash/file operations  
\- Native MCP integration  
\- Agent Skills loading

## **Skill: claude-agent-sdk**

\# skills/dev/claude-agent-sdk/SKILL.md  
\---  
name: claude-agent-sdk  
description: "Build agentic execution with Claude Agent SDK"  
triggers: \["computer use", "gui automation", "bash", "agentic"\]  
\---

\# Claude Agent SDK for Agentic Execution

\#\# Role in Custom Agent Architecture  
Claude Agent SDK provides the EXECUTION ENGINE:  
\- Computer Use: GUI automation for legacy systems  
\- Bash: Shell command execution  
\- Files: Read, write, edit files  
\- MCP: Native Model Context Protocol integration  
\- Skills: Native Agent Skills loading

\#\# Wrapper Pattern for OpenAI SDK Integration  
Create a wrapper that implements OpenAI SDK's HandoffAgent  
but uses Claude Agent SDK internally for execution.

\#\# When Custom Agent Needs Claude SDK  
\- Legacy system automation (no APIs, only GUI)  
\- File processing workflows  
\- Tasks requiring bash/shell access  
\- Deep MCP/Skills integration

\#\# Security: Always Use Agent Sandbox  
Claude Agent SDK execution MUST run in gVisor sandbox  
to prevent untrusted code from affecting host.

# **FastAPI — The HTTP Interface Layer**

FastAPI serves as the HTTP interface for the entire Digital FTE system, handling external requests, A2A protocol endpoints, webhooks, and management APIs.

## **FastAPI Responsibilities**

| Endpoint Type | Purpose | Example |
| ----- | ----- | ----- |
| A2A Discovery | Agent Card for other FTEs to discover | GET /.well-known/agent.json |
| A2A Tasks | Receive tasks from other FTEs | POST /a2a |
| Task Submission | Users/systems submit new tasks | POST /tasks |
| Webhooks | Receive events from Slack, GitHub, etc. | POST /webhooks/slack |
| Human Approval | Managers approve/reject workflow gates | POST /workflows/{id}/approve |
| Health Checks | Kubernetes liveness/readiness probes | GET /health, GET /ready |
| Task Status | Query status of running workflows | GET /tasks/{id}/status |

# **Decision Matrix: When to Use Each Component**

| Task Type | Orchestration | Execution | API Layer | Durability |
| ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- |
| GUI automation (RPA) | OpenAI SDK | Claude SDK | FastAPI | Dapr |
| Multi-day research | OpenAI SDK | Claude SDK | FastAPI | Dapr |
| File processing | OpenAI SDK | Claude SDK | FastAPI | Dapr |
| Simple Q\&A | OpenAI SDK | LiteLLM API | FastAPI | Optional |
| Large doc analysis | OpenAI SDK | Gemini API | FastAPI | Dapr |
| Voice agents | OpenAI SDK | GPT-5 Realtime | FastAPI/WS | Optional |
| Multi-FTE collaboration | OpenAI SDK | Mixed | FastAPI A2A | Dapr |

Key insight: OpenAI Agents SDK ALWAYS handles orchestration. The execution engine varies based on task requirements—Claude Agent SDK for agentic tasks, direct API calls for simple tasks.

# **Agent Evals: The "Exam" for Your Digital FTE**

Enterprises need to know the accuracy rate of a Custom Agent before "hiring" it. Agent Evals test reasoning, not just code.

## **The Golden Dataset**

Before deployment, the Custom Agent must pass 50+ real-world scenarios:

\# evals/invoice-processor/golden\_dataset.yaml

scenarios:  
  \- id: "inv-001"  
    description: "Standard invoice with matching PO"  
    input:  
      invoice\_pdf: "samples/standard\_invoice.pdf"  
      po\_number: "PO-2025-0042"  
    expected:  
      status: "approved"  
      extracted\_amount: 1250.00  
      vendor\_match: true

  \- id: "inv-002"  
    description: "Invoice exceeds approval threshold"  
    input:  
      invoice\_pdf: "samples/large\_invoice.pdf"  
      amount: 15000.00  
    expected:  
      status: "pending\_human\_approval"  
      escalation\_reason: "Amount exceeds $10K threshold"

  \- id: "inv-003"  
    description: "Suspicious duplicate invoice"  
    input:  
      invoice\_pdf: "samples/duplicate\_attempt.pdf"  
    expected:  
      status: "flagged"  
      flag\_reason: "Potential duplicate of INV-2025-1234"

  \# ... 47 more scenarios covering edge cases

## **Accuracy Scoring**

Move beyond Pass/Fail. Use semantic similarity scoring:

* Exact Match: Did the agent get the exact expected output?

* Semantic Match: Did the agent understand the intent even if phrasing differed?

* Regression Testing: Every SKILL.md update triggers the full eval suite

# **Observability: Monitoring Digital FTEs**

| Layer | Tool | What It Tracks | Integration |
| ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- |
| LLM Calls | Logfire / AgentOps | Tokens, latency, cost | OpenAI Agents SDK |
| Agent Execution | OpenTelemetry | Spans, tool calls | Claude Agent SDK |
| Workflows | Dapr Dashboard | Workflow state | Dapr Workflows |
| API Layer | Prometheus | Request rate, errors | FastAPI |
| Infrastructure | Grafana | CPU, memory, pods | Kubernetes |

## **The Hybrid Orchestration Pattern**

The key innovation is separating orchestration from execution:

1. OpenAI Agents SDK handles coordination: handoffs, guardrails, sessions, tracing

2. Claude Agent SDK handles agentic execution: Computer Use, bash, files, MCP, Skills

3. FastAPI provides the HTTP interface: A2A, webhooks, task submission, health checks

4. Dapr provides durability: workflows survive crashes, resume from checkpoints

# 

## **Key Terminology**

| Term | Definition |
| ----- | ----- |
| General Agent | Flexible agent (Claude Code, Goose) that handles diverse tasks with zero-shot planning. THE BUILDER. |
| Custom Agent | Purpose-built agent (via SDK) optimized for specific workflows with guardrails. THE PRODUCT. |
| Digital FTE | Custom Agent priced/sold as equivalent to a full-time employee. Works 168 hrs/week. |
| Agent Factory | System using General Agents \+ Specs to manufacture Custom Skills and Custom Agents at scale. |
| Agent Skills | SKILL.md files containing instructions, logic, workflows. "Expertise Packs" (The How-To). |
| MCP | Model Context Protocol—universal data pipe connecting agents to databases, APIs, systems. |
| Spec-Driven Dev | Methodology where detailed specs are written first, then General Agent generates code to meet them. |
| Agent Evals | Golden Dataset of 50+ scenarios to test Custom Agent accuracy before deployment. |

***Golden Rule: In the era of Agents, your Spec is your Source Code. If you can describe the excellence you want, AI can build the Custom Agent, Skills, and MCP to deliver it for any domain.***

***The hybrid architecture combines the best of both worlds: OpenAI Agents SDK's production-ready orchestration with Claude Agent SDK's unique agentic capabilities. FastAPI ties it all together as the HTTP interface, while Dapr provides zero-cost durable execution. This is a truly production-ready architecture for Digital FTEs.***
